refactor(neon): modernize NEON backend to C++20 std::span and portable popcount

Migrated NEON backend (cpu_backend_neon.hpp) to span-based APIs and added Popcount64 helper using C++20 std::popcount with builtin fallback. Removed unnecessary casts in NEON loads/stores; identifier renames to satisfy readability and runtime-int checks. Achieves parity with SSE2/AVX2 modernization with zero-lint (no suppressions).

Verification:
- clang-tidy: clean on this TU
- Build: PASS (local)
- Tests: PASS (local)
- macOS arm64 CI previously green on NEON path

Files changed:
- include/hyperstream/backend/cpu_backend_neon.hpp
- Docs/DEVLOG.md
- .gitignore (allow Docs/ to be tracked)
